# Simulation-of-an-Autonomous-Wheelchair-using-V-REP
This project was done during my master's degree in Robotics to simulate the movement of an autonomous wheelchair. The project attached is just a sample of the final project. It was used ultrasound sensors to identify the obstacles and avoid collision.

An improvement of the conventional potential field method was used to control an autonomous wheelchair. The potential field method can be applied in dynamic environments where the target and the obstacles are in movement. Using this method it is possible to determine the velocity and the path taken by the robot in order to reach the desired target in the shortest possible time. A hybrid method is used, and it is composed of potential field approach with fuzzy logic, and the Mamdani model is used to obtain the necessary variables to determine the velocity and direction to be followed by the robot.

It was used the programming language Lua to create the logic of the simulation.  Lua is a cross-platform, since the interpreter of compiled bytecode is written in ANSI C, and Lua has a relatively simple C API to embed it into applications.

## Tecnologies Used
