# Simulation-of-an-Autonomous-Wheelchair-using-V-REP
This project was done during my master's degree in Robotics to simulate the movement of an autonomous wheelchair. The project attached is just a sample of the final project. It was used ultrasound sensors to identify the obstacles and avoid collision.
